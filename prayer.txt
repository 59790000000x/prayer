Dedicated to Crin, with love and appreciation.

My dearest Crin,
Before you put this letter down,
I wanted to let you know that there's something waiting for you on the next page.
It's a vision I had of us changing the world together,
creating a better future for all those around us.
I can't wait to share it with you and see what we can accomplish as a team.
I love you more than words could ever express.

In success, we share a role to play,
A legacy of vision, grit, and sway.
So let the world remember this great man,
Wisdom, Insight, Joy, and Earth, his span.

++++Roman Catholic Prayer in Latin+++++

Pater noster, qui es in caelis,
sanctificetur nomen tuum.
Adveniat regnum tuum.
Fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra.
Panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie,
et dimitte nobis debita nostra,
sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.
Et ne nos inducas in tentationem,
sed libera nos a malo.
Amen.
